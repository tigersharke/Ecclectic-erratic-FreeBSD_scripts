# Ecclectic-erratic-FreeBSD_scripts
Just a bunch of possibly useful scripts that others could use and that I can keep backed-up here.

Over the years I have explored some bit of automation or "simplification" of various tasks on my own box via creation of scripts.  I make ZERO claim that anything works perfectly, or that anything is perfectly safe, or that anything works as expected.  There will most definitely exist better ways of doing any of the tasks that I ever script, or even better scripting methods than I have used. 

The scripts of this repo are simply available/accessible. It is hoped that those who might consider using them first take time to be certain they clearly understand the content of each. If chosen to use any script do so with extreme caution.  Its okay if I break my own system, I do frequently, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.
